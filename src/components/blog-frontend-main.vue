    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>If you're just starting with frontend development, we recommend starting with the Level 1
        projects, which focus on basic layouts, color choices, and simple animations. As you progress, you can move on to
        Level 2 projects, which offer a wider variety of designs, interactive elements, and more advanced animations.
    </BlogPortfolioParagraph>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>And if you're feeling confident and ready to push your skills to the next level, you can tackle
        the Level 3 projects, which are some of the most complex and challenging projects on the site.
