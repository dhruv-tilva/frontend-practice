            Frontend Practice and how it works.</h1>
        <p class="mt-16 font-archivo text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto font-normal leading-relaxed mb-5">At Frontend Practice, we
            believe there is great value in recreating real websites as a form of coding practice. With our large collection
            of hand-picked projects to choose from, there's something for everyone, no matter your skill level.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 font-archivo text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto font-normal leading-relaxed mb-5">One advantage of this
            particular type of coding practice is that you can use any technology you prefer, including HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, or your favorite framework or library.
        </p>
        <h2 class="max-w-2xl text-3xl font-bold font-dm mx-auto my-5 lg:my-6">To get started:</h2>
        <p class="mt-16 font-archivo text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto font-normal leading-relaxed mb-5">Create a new HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript file and begin recreating the web pages that are featured in our projects. If you prefer to work with
            a specific framework or library, you can install the package of your choice with the command line and start
            building.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 font-archivo text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto font-normal leading-relaxed mb-5">Each project on Frontend
            Practice comes with a recommended course and helpful resources, including color palettes, reference images, and
            links to free photo assets and icons.
