    <BlogPortfolioHaeding>First and foremost, start.</BlogPortfolioHaeding>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>It may sound simple, but this is the most important piece of advice I can
        give you. No one but you is going to create your portfolio. So, get
        started!</BlogPortfolioParagraph>

    <BlogPortfolioHaeding>Before you start coding, pick a theme.</BlogPortfolioHaeding>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>Having a theme in mind while building can significantly speed up the
        creation of your portfolio. By "theme", I mean the overall look and feel you
        want for your website, such as minimal, a black-and-white palette, a
        grid-focused approach, etc. Once you have decided on your theme, stick to
        it!</BlogPortfolioParagraph>

    <BlogPortfolioHaeding>When in doubt, look for inspiration.</BlogPortfolioHaeding>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>Looking at websites other developers and designers have created can be an
        invaluable source of both inspiration and knowledge. However, I'm not
        suggesting that you copy someone else's work. Instead, let their designs
        spark your creativity and teach you new design techniques and
        trends.</BlogPortfolioParagraph>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>One of my favorite inspirational resources is Siteinspire.

    </BlogPortfolioParagraph>

    <BlogPortfolioHaeding>Write your content before building a new page.</BlogPortfolioHaeding>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>Before you start on a new page, try writing down your content or most of
        it. This allows you to focus solely on the content of your page without
        worrying about the coding or design. Plus it will also speed up the building
        process as you'll have real content to work with.</BlogPortfolioParagraph>

    <BlogPortfolioHaeding>Finish one part and quickly move to the next.</BlogPortfolioHaeding>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>Avoid making constant changes to the same section. This might be great for
        exploring new designs and ideas but not for finishing your portfolio in a
        timely manner.</BlogPortfolioParagraph>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>Get your basic layout, colors, and content setup, and then move on to the
        next section. Once you've built out your page, then go back through and make
        any necessary changes.</BlogPortfolioParagraph>

    <BlogPortfolioHaeding>Projects: If you're proud of it, include it.</BlogPortfolioHaeding>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>This is one is pretty self-explanatory. There is no need to include every
        project you have ever built since you started
        programming.</BlogPortfolioParagraph>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>Ask yourself two questions:</BlogPortfolioParagraph>
    <ol class="max-w-2xl mx-automb-6 mx-auto pl-6 w-full list-decimal leading-normal text-lg font-normal">
        <li>"Am I proud of this project?"</li>
        <li>
            "Would I be willing to show this to a potential employer or client?"
        </li>
    </ol>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>If the answers are yes, then add it to your
        portfolio.</BlogPortfolioParagraph>

    <BlogPortfolioHaeding>Set a [soft] deadline.</BlogPortfolioHaeding>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>Even if it's two weeks or two months, set a soft deadline and try your best
        to stick to it but also be realistic in regards to your own life and how
        much time you have to work on it.</BlogPortfolioParagraph>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>Two months is a reasonable deadline to set for yourself. This is long
        enough to spend quite a few hours working on your portfolio. Remember, the
        goal is to finish your portfolio, it does not have to be absolutely perfect.
        You can always come back and make changes later.</BlogPortfolioParagraph>

    <BlogPortfolioHaeding>Share your progress.</BlogPortfolioHaeding>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>Sharing with friends and family, or on social media is a great motivator to
        finish your portfolio. It provides accountability, feedback, and support
        when you need it most.</BlogPortfolioParagraph>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>Accountability to help us with our deadlines, feedback to fine-tune and fix
        areas we might have overlooked, and support for those days when we need a
        reminder that we're doing a great job.
    </BlogPortfolioParagraph>

    <BlogPortfolioHaeding>Most importantly, have fun with it.</BlogPortfolioHaeding>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>Try not to overthink it. This is your little slice of the internet and you
        can do whatever you want with it. Make it as simple or as complex as you
        want.</BlogPortfolioParagraph>

    <BlogPortfolioHaeding>And finally, go live!</BlogPortfolioHaeding>
    <BlogPortfolioParagraph>Take a deep breath, pat yourself on the back, and hit that publish button!
        There are plenty of options out there for hosting, so do your research. We
        share a handful of recommendations in our
